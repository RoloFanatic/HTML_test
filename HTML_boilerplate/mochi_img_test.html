        <h1>Image formats</h1>
        <h2>JPG images</h2>
        <p>This is a JPEG image. JPG images have small file sizes but a large colour pallette. Transparent pixels are not allowed.</p>
        <img class="mochi" src="./img/mochi.jpg" alt="Cute JPEG of a mochi">

        <h2>PNG images</h2>
        <p>PNG images are usually much larger files than JPEGs but they do not have limitations on their colour palette, and allow transparent pixels. Note how the white borders around the image are no longer visible.</p>
        <img class="mochi" src="./img/mochi.png" alt="Cute png of a mochi">

        <h2>SVG images</h2>
        <p>SVG images are fantastic, they are vector based graphics which scale to any dimension with no loss of quality. They are ideal for websites and should be used wherever possible.</p>
        <ul class="mochi_eg">
            <li><img class="mochi" src="./img/mochi.svg" alt="Cute small SVG of a mochi"></li>
            <li><img class="mochi2" src="./img/mochi.svg" alt="Cute large SVG of a mochi"></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <p> The final image type which is commonly used all over the web is the GIF. GIFs are different to other images in that they are not static images, but simple animations. They are limited in their colour palette and can only have binary transparent or opaque pixels.</p>
