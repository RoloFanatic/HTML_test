    <p>This is a test of the paragraph feature of html...Seems to be working, I have altered the size, colour, and font style of the text.</p>
    <p>This is a test of the <strong>BOLD</strong> feature...</p>
    <p>...and this is how you do an <em>italic</em>...</p>

    <!-- this is how you write an in text message that will not be displayed in the web page,
         DO NOT USE <b> for gold, or <i> for italic. These add visual queues to the txt but
         not importance (which is IMPORTANT)-->

<!-- Inclusion of http at the start of the <a> indicates that it is an ABSOLUTE link,
    without the http:// makes a RELATIVE link which looks for a file in the same directory... -->
